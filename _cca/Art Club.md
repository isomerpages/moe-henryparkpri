Art Club believes in nurturing the artistic talents of our students and fostering their imaginative minds. We focus on creating different crafts as well as developing students' art technical skills. Under the guidance of teachers, we hope to instill in students independent learning and a love for Art. Through self-reflection, students learn to appreciate their own and peers' art forms, that will enrich their experiences towards self-discovery and self-expression. Through meaningful art tasks, members develop responsibility, resilience and creative-thinking skills. We also encourage our students to be socially aware, critique in kindness and form firm friendships through their love for art.
