Art Club focuses on creating different crafts as well as developing students’ art technical skills. We encourage the use of different materials in creating crafts to widen students’ interest and promote innovative thinking. Under the guidance of teachers, we hope to instill in students independent learning and a love for Art. Through self-reflection, students learn to appreciate their own and peers’ art forms, that will enrich their experiences during the process of learning. Through meaningful art tasks, members develop responsibility, resilience and creative-thinking skills. We also encourage our students to be socially aware, critique in kindness and forming firm friendships through their love for art.
