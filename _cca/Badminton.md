**Badminton Training Team**  

The Badminton Training Team CCA members train twice a week with the goal of representing the school to participate in inter-school competitions. They undergo tough physical fitness conditioning and sharpening of technical skills like lobbing, smashing and net play. They will also learn both singles and doubles gameplay, and strategies to attack and defend against their opponents. Members learn to be responsible and disciplined during training and to care for themselves, as well as for their fellow teammates. Through the training, the members learn how to work as team and from there, friendships are forged. Their passion for the sport will grow stronger too.

		 
**Badminton Recreational Team**  
  
The Recreational Badminton CCA provides members with the opportunity to learn basic skills and techniques of the sport such as service, basic strokes and footwork necessary for them to play an enjoyable game with their friends.&nbsp; Teachable moments occurring out of CCA activities are seized to teach the school values of RICE to the members.&nbsp; Through game play, members learn the importance of resilience and teamwork. Valuable friendships are also built as our members interact with each other regularly.&nbsp; In pursuing sporting excellence, some students are given the opportunity to join the school training team if they perform well at a selection trial.
