<p>Through the love of basketball, we strive to provide our members with
opportunities to develop focus, motor coordination, flexibility, and endurance.
Basketballers move fast and react quickly as they change directions, pivot,
run and jump. These elements give our members the opportunity to develop
their motor skills and coordination.</p>
<p>Basketball CCA also develops our membersâ€™ self-confidence as they find
their voice and adapt to new situations that they will be engaged in during
games. As a team, our members encourage, motivate, and support each other.</p>
<p>To develop leadership skills, our members are given opportunities to work
on their own game plans. This allows them to apply thinking skills and
flexibility in complex situations. With our coach, our members make informed
choices and chart their own learning progress, nurturing them to be self-directed
learners. &nbsp;Post games, our members reflect on their performance as
an individual and as a team to identify areas of improvement and work on
them in the following sessions.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that the values and work ethics that brings success
on court will benefit our members immensely in other aspects of their life.</p>
