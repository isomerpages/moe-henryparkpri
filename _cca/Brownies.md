The Brownies programme is based on the guiding movement that provides opportunities for girls to discover and develop their strengths and skills, to reach their fullest potential, and to become responsible citizens of the world. Since the Girl Guides Movement began in Singapore in 1917, Brownies has continued to achieve our mission of building girls of courage, confidence and character who make the world a better place.&nbsp;

The Brownies CCA conducts activities which inculcate values based on the Brownies Promise, Law and Motto. Our programme consists of fun-filled, exciting activities like camps, competitions, entrepreneurship, and learning journeys. As the Brownies go through the three-year programme, they achieve badges for themselves as accomplishments.&nbsp; They learn and put into practice essential life-skills like thinking of others before themselves and lending a hand to those in need.
