**Our Goals**

1.  To offer students opportunities to pursue their interest in Sports & Games, Clubs & Societies, Performing Arts or Uniformed Groups.
2.  To realise potential of students in their interest areas.
3.  To inculcate school values in students.
4.  To provide opportunity to discover, develop and display their talent through CCAs.

  

### Programmes

In Henry Park Primary School, a variety of CCAs are offered to appeal to the wide range of interest of the students. Recreational CCAs are available to the P3 to P6 students to pursue their interest and to discover and/or develop their talent as they pick up skills at a beginner level or improve on them. Training/ School teams CCAs are for students who show promise in their respective fields and will undergo training to further develop and display their talent at the inter-school, national and/or inter-national level.
