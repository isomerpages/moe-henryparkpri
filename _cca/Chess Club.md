Henry Park Primary School Chess Club consists of 2 teams, Recreational and School Training Team. Both teams will be guided by coaches and CCA teachers during each CCA session. The lessons are planned to enable our members to develop critical thinking skills, make calculations, analyse variations and improve visualisation. The coaches will then give scenarios for members to solve, allowing them to apply the strategies learnt. The main difference between the School Training and Recreational team is the pace and level at which the lesson is carried out. During our sessions, our members will also get a chance to play with different partners to apply what they have learnt.
