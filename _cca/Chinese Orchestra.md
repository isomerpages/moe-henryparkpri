The mention of “Chinese Orchestra” might have some of us associating it with ancient music that is old school. However, the HPPS Chinese Orchestra is more than this stereotype that some people hold. The Chinese Orchestra aims to instill discipline, resilience, teamwork and appreciation of Chinese music in our members. Members can choose from a wide variety of Chinese instruments and learn to play different genres of music. Under the guidance of our instructors, Mr Wong Chee Kong and Mr Chan Choon Hoe, our young musicians have built resilience and displayed great teamwork as they persevere in their musical journey.
