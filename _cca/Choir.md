The HPPS Choir has been around since the inception of the school in the late 1970s. Through the years, the choir members have taken part in the Singapore Youth Fetival Arts Presentations, National Day Parade, community outreach programmes for our local festivals and international choir festival competitions. Each year, the choir is about almost 60 strong, with students from P3 to P6.
There is an audition/ voice placement test to ascertain if the student can pitch, keep a steady beat and if they can imitate rhythm. Members usually meet once a week but when preparing for competition and performances, they will rehearse twice a week.
