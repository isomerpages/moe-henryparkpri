Contemporary Dance in Henry Park Primary School is a CCA that allows pupils to learn the different genres of dance. Students take part in an audition before being selected for the CCA. The CCA provides opportunities for students to demonstrate teamwork as they help one another to learn the routines, overcome challenges and manage stress especially before performances. As our dancers prepare to perform at school events and competitions, the dance instructor introduces and provides opportunities for members to experiment with new dance moves to increase their dance knowledge.
