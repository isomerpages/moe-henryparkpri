At the English Oratorical Club, pupils are given opportunities to hone their public speaking skills. With qualified instructors to guide them, pupils learn to conduct research, organise and articulate their thoughts and express them eloquently. They learn to connect with their audience with a clear understanding of the purpose and context. 
As pupils embark on research to deepen their knowledge on the content matter, they learn to be more discerning of the information presented to them. English Oratorical Club encourages collaborative learning, giving students ample opportunities to work in group and foster teamwork. 
With the various experiences provided, students are not only equipped with effective communication and presentation skills, we also instil in them critical thinking and self-reflection, ensuring that they emerge as well-rounded and confident communicators.
