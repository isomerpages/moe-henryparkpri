In English Oratorical Club, students are given opportunities to showcase their talents in delivering speeches, being emcees at events or participating in friendly debate matches in school and in national competitions. Students are passionate to learn and practise skills in public speaking.&nbsp;

Students are advocates to support causes they care about. They are encouraged to be open-minded, examine ideas from differing viewpoints and remain calm and composed in stressful situations.&nbsp;

  

They practise writing techniques for speeches and learn to communicate clearly and concisely. They are required to research on current and controversial issues, and challenged to think out of the box. They learn to use creativity and imagination to construct sound and logical arguments. They get to practise collaborative skills and develop camaraderie with their peers.
