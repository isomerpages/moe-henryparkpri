<p>The Floorball CCA is set up in 2024. Floorball is a fast-paced and dynamic
team sport. Played indoors with a plastic ball and sticks, it emphasizes
agility, teamwork, and strategy. It provides students with a holistic physical
and mental workout, improving their endurance, coordination, and cognitive
skills.</p>
<p>Our main objective in forming the Floorball CCA is to nurture students
into confident and disciplined athletes who value teamwork, sportsmanship,
and perseverance. With a dedicated coach, we aim to create a vibrant and
supportive environment in this CCA where students can challenge themselves,
grow, and form lasting friendships.</p>
