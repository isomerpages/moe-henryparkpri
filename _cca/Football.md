**Football Training Team**

Boys in the Football Training Team go through rigorous training sessions to improve their physical fitness and football skills in preparation for the Zonal and National Football competitions. Apart from becoming a more skilful player, the boys get opportunities to internalise values such as sportsmanship and resilience. Through the CCA, the boys also develop strong friendships with one another. 

In 2019, the Junior Boys clinched the National School Games title. We were Champions for the first time in the school’s history. In 2020 and 2021, there was no NSG competition due to COVID-19. The boys continued to train hard according to Safe Management Measures. In April 2021, we held our own internal competition as a farewell to the Senior Boys.

**Football Recreational Team**

Recreational Football is not only been a safe place for the students to have fun but also a time where very valuable lessons are learned. While the students learn basic football skills such as dribbling and passing, values such as respect, integrity, care and sportsmanship are taught. Through engaging activities such as practice matches and drills, students demonstrated social and emotional growth and learning by working together as a team to achieve their goals. 

In 2021, students have also adapted well to the new safety measurements put in place due to COVID-19, thus showing their determination and adaptability.
