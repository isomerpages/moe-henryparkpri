Football Training Team

Boys in the Football Training Team go through rigorous training sessions to improve their physical fitness and football skills in preparation for the Zonal and National Football competitions. Apart from becoming a more skilful player, the boys get opportunities to internalise values such as sportsmanship and resilience. Through the CCA, the boys also develop strong friendships with one another. 

In 2019, the Junior Boys clinched the National School Games title. We were Champions for the first time in the school’s history. In 2020 and 2021, there was no NSG competition due to COVID-19. The boys continued to train hard according to Safe Management Measures. In April 2021, we held our own internal competition as a farewell to the Senior Boys.
