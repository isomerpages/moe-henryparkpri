The Girls’ Brigade (GB) is an international, interdenominational Christian youth organisation for girls which was first established in Singapore in 1927. The 43rd Girls’ Brigade Company was started in Henry Park Primary School in 1998.
While GB serves as a platform for girls to develop their character and hone their leadership skills, the activities aim to nurture our girls to be adept intellectually, spiritually, socially and physically, preparing them to make a difference in society.
In a year, the girls work towards earning badges through their participation in various activities, such as learning a new skill, going on learning journeys and attending camps. The girls also participate in national competitions and national camps annually.  
Girls do not have to be of the Christian faith to join.
