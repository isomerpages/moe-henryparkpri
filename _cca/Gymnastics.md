**Gymnastics Training Team**  

Gymnastics is a physically demanding sport. To maintain their skills, form and flexibility, our gymnasts put in 6 to 9 training hours a week. Gymnasts need to possess the mental strength to endure the strenuous training sessions. The rigorous training inculcates perseverance, endurance and resilience in the gymnasts. Gymnastics is also a sport that builds self-discipline and gymnasts must adhere to the safety rules at all times. The Gymnastics CCA aims to mould our gymnasts to become individuals who display our school values of Respect, Integrity, Care and Excellence as well as sportsmanship, during and outside of training sessions.

**Gymnastics Recreational Team**  

The aim of Recreational Gymnastics CCA is to introduce basic gymnastics skills to the members. Beginners learn simple movements before moving on to more difficult ones. Membersâ€™ confidence gradually increases as they master the simpler moves and this helps them to overcome the fear of learning the challenging moves. There is also an aesthetics part to gymnastics which focuses on the body posture. Activities conducted using the CCA Facilitation Toolkit allow members to bond and deepen their understanding of themselves and their peers. Members who show great potential will be invited to join the School Gymnastics Training Team.
