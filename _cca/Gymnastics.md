**Gymnastics Training Team**  

Gymnastics is a physically demanding sport. To maintain their skills, form and flexibility, our gymnasts put in at least 6 training hours per week. Gymnasts need to possess the mental strength to endure the strenuous training sessions. The rigorous training inculcates perseverance, endurance and resilience in the gymnasts. Gymnastics is also a sport that builds self-discipline and gymnasts must adhere to the safety rules at all times. The Gymnastics CCA aims to mould our gymnasts to become individuals who display our school values of Respect, Integrity, Care and Excellence as well as sportsmanship, during and outside of training sessions and competitions.

**Gymnastics Recreational Team**  

Recreational Gymnastics CCA offers a welcoming and inclusive environment for students of all abilities to experience the joy of gymnastics without the pressure of competition. The aim of Recreational Gymnastics CCA is to introduce basic gymnastics skills to the members. Beginners learn simple movements before moving on to more difficult ones. Membersâ€™ confidence gradually increases as they master the simpler moves. This helps them to overcome the fear of learning the challenging moves. Recreational gymnastics is also a fantastic way to improve overall physical fitness. It enhances strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular endurance while promoting better posture and body awareness. Members who show great potential will be invited to join the School Gymnastics Training Team.
