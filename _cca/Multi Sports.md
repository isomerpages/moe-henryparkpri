Multi-Sports is a CCA where members learn and improve on skills in various sports such as touch rugby, football tennis and floorball. Different types of sports will be introduced termly. Some of these sports are new to the students so they have an opportunity in trying sports that they are not familiar with. This year, due to the pandemic, our CCA sessions were conducted in alternate weeks between online and face-to-face. Other than learning about various games and sports, members also learn about values such as teamwork, perseverance, discipline and respect. Through the sessions, members are taught that one aim of sports is to build resilience in themselves while having fun. As the games are more friendly games in nature, members learn the importance of forging friendships and learning from one another. Multi-Sports is a CCA that welcomes students who enjoy playing sports in a non-competitive environment.
