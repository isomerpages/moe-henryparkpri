<p>Multi-sport is a CCA where members learn and improve on skills in various
sports such as touch rugby, football tennis and floorball. Different types
of sports will be introduced termly. Some of these sports are new to the
students so they have an opportunity in trying sports that they are not
familiar with. Other than learning about various games and sports, members
also learn about values such as teamwork, perseverance, discipline and
respect. Through the sessions, members are taught that one aim of sports
is to build resilience in themselves while having fun. As the games are
more friendly in nature, members learn the importance of forging friendships
and learning from one another. Multi-sport is a CCA that welcomes students
who enjoy playing sports in a non-competitive environment.</p>
