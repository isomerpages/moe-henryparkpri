Netball is an exciting, fast game requiring consummate elegance. In HPPS, the netball girls learn to master the game through the schoolâ€™s RICE values. Respect for the game and the opponents by training hard two times a week. Integrity through their accountability in their continual training outside of school hours. Care for their teammates by checking in with each other on their school work and personal lives. Excellence in the pursuance of top honours during the Zonal and National schools competition. Despite the lack of competition opportunities because of the Covid-19 situation, the girls still got to experience some semblance of competitiveness through a mini netball carnival held in school.
