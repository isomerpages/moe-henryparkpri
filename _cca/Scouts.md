Scouting is a worldwide youth movement with the aim of supporting young people in their physical, mental and spiritual development, through the Scout Method, that they may play constructive roles in society. 

In Scouts, we inculcate discipline, leadership qualities and teamwork attributes through informal educational processes. The CCA embodies the scouting way of life, its Promise, Law and Motto with fun-filled, exciting programmes. Our scouts discover, learn and put into practice essential life-skills through serving others and learning by doing. They also learn to face and overcome challenges through self-developmental activities that encourage “Fun and Discovery” amongst the cub scouts.
