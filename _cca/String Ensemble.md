The Henry Park Primary School String Ensemble CCA is made up of students of diverse backgrounds, but they all have one thing in common – a passion for music. 
Our CCA is made up of two teams – the school team, and the beginner team. In the beginner team, students with no prior knowledge of playing a string instrument can join and start learning a new instrument. They can choose from the following instruments – Violin, Viola, Cello and Double Bass. In the school team, students with prior knowledge of playing a string instrument learn ensemble skills and musicianship. In both teams, we seek to grow the interests and talents of every student and give them opportunities to learn new skills and values. Through playing together as a team, students learn values such as teamwork, resilience, and perseverance.
Students are also given opportunities to showcase their talents through performances. Every two years, our String Ensemble participates in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP), where the students perform on a national level and get feedback from industry professionals. Our String Ensemble also performs in school concerts and participates in school events.
