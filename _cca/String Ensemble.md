The Henry Park Primary School (HPPS) String Ensemble has grown over the past three years. To date, we have 32 members who are passionate and talented in music. In our CCA, we seek to grow the interests and talents of every pupil by providing them equal opportunities to shine.

  

During the Circuit Breaker in 2020, we met virtually and individually recorded a combined performance titled, “Over the Rainbow”. Despite the many challenges we face due to Covid-19, our members continue to train on alternate Fridays from 1.45 p.m. to 3.45 p.m. During the CCA sessions, our members acquire musicianship and ensemble skills as well as good values such as teamwork, resilience and perseverance through playing together as a team. Students are also given opportunities to contribute to the wider community through our Values-In-Action project. 

  

We hope that our members will be inspired to pursue their strong interest in music and continue their growth as musicians and as active contributors to the society of Singapore.
