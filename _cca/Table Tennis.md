Table Tennis CCA adopts a participant-centric approach to provide opportunities and platforms for the members of differing skill levels to experience the joy of physical activity when engaging in the sport. 
Members progress from recreational team to training team before eventually donning the school colors to participate in the National School Games. Senior members of the school team take turn to lead warm-up and take junior members under their wings. Beyond skills and techniques, students build social emotional competencies through every success and setback in their matches.
