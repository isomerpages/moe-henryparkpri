The main focus of the Table Tennis CCA is to provide opportunities for the members to experience the joy when engaging in the sport. As members play the sport with each other, they learn the basic ball skills and the rules of the game. Routines prior to and after each training session inculcate values of respect and care as members set up and clear the play area and equipment for the training sessions together. Seniors who possess good table tennis skills and display leadership qualities guide the younger players alongside the teachers. Through this, they learn to be patient and responsible.
