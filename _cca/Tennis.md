The Tennis CCA focuses on the development of sport-related skills, fitness and character through the involvement of sports. Through rigorous training sessions and participation in competitions, resilience is built. Members learn to embrace challenges and not avoid them. The CCA hopes to develop self-discipline in our members as it is an integral part of sports excellence and character building. Through game play at training sessions or competitions, members learn the rules and strategies in tennis. Sportsmanship is emphasised consistently to inculcate values like fairness and integrity. Great emphasis is placed on teamwork among the members to ensure everyone feels accepted.
