Track and Field CCA was started in 2015 and has grown steadily in numbers over the years. Students are identified from the P3 CCA trials to join the training team. The team trains and prepares for the various competitions throughout the year. 
Students are exposed to running various distances, throwing different implements as well as trying out the different types of jumps. Students with potential in the various events are selected for the school team to represent the school at the National School Games.
In the 2023 National School Games, the HPPS Track and Field team achieved a total of 4 individual Gold, 3 relay Gold, 6 individual Silver, 1 relay Silver, 3 individual Bronze, 1 relay bronze and 23 other Top 8 positions. Our Senior Girls team also came in 1st runner-up in the Divisional Challenge. Congratulations to the team!
