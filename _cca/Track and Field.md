Track and Field CCA was started in 2015 and has grown steadily in numbers over the years. Students are identified from P2/P3 CCA trials as well as from the Annual Athletic Meet to join the training team. The team trains and prepares for the various competitions throughout the year. Students are exposed to running various distances, throwing different implements as well as trying out the different types of jumps. Students with potential in the various events are selected for the school team to represent the school at the National School Games.
