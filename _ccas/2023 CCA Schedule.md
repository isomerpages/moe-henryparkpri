Recreational CCAs are offered to P3 to P6 students.

Recreational CCA sessions will start in Term 1 Week 4 (26 Jan or 27 Jan).

Some CCAs may have large enrolment.  For these CCAs, CCA sessions may be conducted using the Blended Learning approach.

Please note that school buses will only be provided at 4pm in 2023. Students who are taking the school buses will be dismissed from their CCAs earlier.  For students who are in CCA that ends after 4.15pm will have to make their own transport arrangement home.

For enquiries pertaining to specific CCA, please email the respective teachers in-charge.
