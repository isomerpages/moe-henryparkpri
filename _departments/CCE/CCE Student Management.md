<p><strong>Student Leadership Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>The Tiering System allows students to progress up the scale of leadership
according to their level of competence and the degree of responsibility
given to them through their respective leadership opportunities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sub>Note:</sub>
</p>
<p><sub>Each tier has its own selection criteria and expectations.</sub>
</p>
<p><sub>Student Leadership Committee will have a generic training for all Student Leaders so they understand and are aligned in expectations of their position</sub>
</p>
<p><sub>Tier 2 and above, departments will add on specific trainings for students to hone specific skills related to their position.</sub>
</p>

<p>The primary focus of the Henry Park Primary School Leadership Framework
which is aligned to the School’s Vision is to mentor and guide students
towards becoming exemplary Leaders of Character, serving with their unique
talents. The concept of leading with character encompasses specific nuances,
including the school's core values of Respect, Integrity, Care and Excellence.</p>
<p>Drawing certain references from the Leadership Challenge Model (Kouzes
and Posner), we&nbsp; belief that leadership is a skill that can be harnessed
with sufficient knowledge and practice. This model leverages the 5 Practices
of Exemplary Leadership — model the way, inspire a shared vision, challenge
the process, enable others to act, and encourage the heart which we have
tweaked to align to our schools needs and abilities.</p>
<p>Throughout their engagement with various key areas of leadership development,
including leadership training, significant leadership experiences, leadership
assessment, mentoring, and the application of skills in assigned responsibilities,
students are consistently reminded of the significance of the school's
values and social-emotional learning (SEL) competencies.</p>
<p><strong>3 E Tiered Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Following the 3 E (Educate, Enable, and Empower) tiered approach), the
framework emphasizes creating opportunities for students to apply the values
they've learned in serving the school and society, thereby contributing
to the improvement of their environment. This is aligned to both the Leadership
Tiered Approach and the Tiered Training Approach. This alignment across
the school to achieve the desired outcomes.</p>
