<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>Guided by the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Framework, the
department seeks to nurture upright and responsible leaders through the
CCE programme. By providing varied opportunities to teach CCE, the department
aims to nurture and develop citizenry in students who possess good character
and display the desired social and emotional competencies.</p>
<h3>Our Programmes</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Discipline</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope to instil in all pupils the value of self-discipline. We believe
that in acquiring self-discipline, pupils will inevitably be&nbsp;able
to overcome any obstacles they may encounter. Self-discipline is a life-long
value that will serve and benefit&nbsp;them&nbsp;tremendously as they grow
and mature. Pupils are expected and encouraged to manage their own behaviour
so&nbsp;as to&nbsp;demonstrate the value of self-discipline.</p>

<p>National Education (NE)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>National Education (NE) is part of holistic education. It aims to foster
national cohesion and boost students’ confidence in our&nbsp;nation’s future.
It also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness
to Singapore. National Education is infused with the primary school curriculum.
Social Studies integrates History and Geography with some&nbsp;basic Economics
and Sociology. Emphasis is placed on the application of knowledge and skills,
and the acquisition&nbsp;of values.</p>
<p>NE comprises four core annual events</p>

<p><strong>Programme Highlights</strong>
</p>
<p>Learning Journeys are interactive experiences that allow students to deepen
their knowledge and understanding of Singapore’s history, geography and
culture. The trips enable pupils to:</p>
<p>• understand and appreciate the rich cultural and historical heritage
of our people;</p>
<p>• foster a sense of pride in the rich diversity of our heritage;</p>
<p>• share a common bond which will hold our society together as a people
and as a nation.</p>

<li>
<p>Values-In-Action (VIA)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Values in Action programme serves to involve our pupils in various
projects to give them the opportunity to&nbsp; demonstrate&nbsp;the school
values. Besides being involved in planned community projects, our students
are encouraged to&nbsp;self-initiate&nbsp;projects&nbsp;to benefit those
around them. This ties in with the school’s leadership and character development
programmes, where we&nbsp;seek&nbsp;to provide a holistic and well-rounded
education for our pupils.</p>
