Our Goal
--------

Guided by the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Framework, the department seeks to nurture upright and responsible leaders through the CCE programme. By providing varied opportunities to teach CCE, the department aims to nurture and develop citizenry in students who possess good character and display the desired social and emotional competencies.

### Our Programmes

1. Discipline

We hope to instil in all pupils the value of self-discipline. We believe that in acquiring self-discipline, pupils will inevitably be&nbsp;able to overcome any obstacles they may encounter. Self-discipline is a life-long value that will serve and benefit&nbsp;them&nbsp;tremendously as they grow and mature. Pupils are expected and encouraged to manage their own behaviour so&nbsp;as to&nbsp;demonstrate the value of self-discipline.

2. National Education (NE)

National Education (NE) is part of holistic education. It aims to foster national cohesion and boost students’ confidence in our&nbsp;nation’s future. It also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore. National Education is infused with the primary school curriculum. Social Studies integrates History and Geography with some&nbsp;basic Economics and Sociology. Emphasis is placed on the application of knowledge and skills, and the acquisition&nbsp;of values.

NE comprises four core annual events

*   Total Defence Day
*   International Friendship Day
*   Racial Harmony Day
*   National Day

  

**Programme Highlights**

Learning Journeys are interactive experiences that allow students to deepen their knowledge and understanding of Singapore’s history, geography and culture. The trips enable pupils to:

• understand and appreciate the rich cultural and historical heritage of our people;

• foster a sense of pride in the rich diversity of our heritage;

• share a common bond which will hold our society together as a people and as a nation.

  

3. Values-In-Action (VIA)

The Values in Action programme serves to involve our pupils in various projects to give them the opportunity to&nbsp;
demonstrate&nbsp;the school values. Besides being involved in planned community projects, our students are encouraged to&nbsp;self-initiate&nbsp;projects&nbsp;to benefit those around them. This ties in with the school’s leadership and character development programmes, where we&nbsp;seek&nbsp;to provide a holistic and well-rounded education for our pupils.


4. Character Building

The objective of the Character Building programme is to instil character values in every student using the school values

R.I.C.E.&nbsp;  

There is a 6 year roll-out plan for every student. The activities that are carried out for every student are as follows:  

**Explicit Teaching**

Teachers teach character values in the classrooms during Assembly period. Students are provided with case studies and scenarios where they can apply the values taught to solve the issues raised.&nbsp;

**Incidental Infusion**

Teachers incorporate desired character values into their teaching.

**Infusion into IP and Non-IP Subjects**

Subject teachers will teach character values specified in the Scheme of Work.

  

5. Contemporary Issues

Students explore various contemporary issues to gain greater awareness of the world around them. Our students construct&nbsp;new&nbsp;knowledge through a collaborative process and broaden their minds to other perspectives. In the process, developing&nbsp;their own&nbsp;citizenship dispositions.&nbsp;
