<h4><strong><u>What is Educational Technology (EdTech)?</u></strong></h4>
<p>Educational Technology (EdTech) is the strategic use of technology to
enhance learning and achieve educational outcomes. It taps into various
digital tools to support teaching and learning processes, preparing students
for a digital future. EdTech facilitates personalised and self-paced learning,
offers access to vast online resources and enables collaboration among
students online. By leveraging these digital tools, teachers can create
a more engaging, efficient and inclusive learning environment that caters
to diverse learning styles. As technology evolves, EdTech becomes increasingly
crucial in developing students’ digital literacy and 21<sup>st</sup>-century
skills, which are essential for success in an increasingly interconnected
world.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>HPPS EdTech Curriculum and Programmes</u></strong></h4>
<p>At Henry Park Primary School (HPPS), the EdTech curriculum implemented
is structured around the Find, Think, Apply, Create (FTAC) framework from
MOE’s National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP). Our EdTech curriculum
ensures that the students develop digital literacy and technological skills
progressively from Primary 1 to Primary 6.</p>
<p>Our EdTech programme is integrated across all subjects, providing students
with diverse learning opportunities to acquire and apply digital skills.
We utilise the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) platform to offer
online self-paced learning modules, allowing students to enhance their
digital competencies at their own pace.</p>
<p>This holistic approach ensures that HPPS students become Informed Digital
Natives as they not only learn about technology but also learn with technology,
preparing them for the digital world of the future.</p>
