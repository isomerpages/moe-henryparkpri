### Our Programmes

##### **READING – READING PERIOD ACTIVITIES AND LITERATURE PROGRAMME**

To develop our students’ interest in reading, we have a Reading Period every week from Primary One to Six. During this period, students are engaged in the following activities:

*   Reading Passport and Reading Rainbow (P1-P2)
*   Reading Bingo (P3)
*   Amazing Reading Race (P4)
*   Book Bugs (in collaboration with NLB) (P5)

  

Through our Literature programme, students are taught to appreciate and analyse good language use and to be sensitive and empathetic towards others through the stories of the lives of the characters. Our students go through the Literature Programme from Primary Three to Six. The literature texts covered are as follows:

*   Chicken Soup for the Kids' Soul 
*   Charlotte’s Web
*   Sing to the Dawn
