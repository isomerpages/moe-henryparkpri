<p>Computing Enrichment Programme (CEP) helps to prepare our pupils for an
Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-savvy future. Pupils are
given the opportunity to develop their ICT skills by producing creative
products such as Sketch games and coding using Python. CEP is reviewed
annually to determine which ICT skills best meet the pupilsâ€™ learning needs
and interests.</p>
