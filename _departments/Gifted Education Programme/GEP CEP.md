Computing Enrichment Programme (CEP) helps to prepare our pupils for an Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-savvy future. Pupils are given the opportunity to develop their ICT skills by producing creative products such as Sketch games, Kinetic Typography Animations, videos and webpages. CEP is reviewed annually to determine which ICT skills best meet the pupilsâ€™ learning needs and interests.
