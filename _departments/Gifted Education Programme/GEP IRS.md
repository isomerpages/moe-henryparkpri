<p>The IRS has been a cornerstone in the GEP enriched curriculum for many
years. It is an independent research project based on pupils' personal
interests. It aims to develop in pupils library research skills, inquiry
skills, learning-how-to-learn skills as well as written, oral and visual
communication skills. It offers pupils the opportunity to pursue a self-selected
real-life problem like a "practising professional" would.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The P4 GEP pupils are introduced to research and formally taught research
skills and processes. When these pupils go to P5, they are expected to
apply and internalize their research skills and knowledge of research through
experiential learning â€“ completing a research project of their interest.</p>
