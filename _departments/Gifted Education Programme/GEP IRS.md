*   The IRS has been a cornerstone in the GEP enriched curriculum for many years. It is an independent research project based on pupils' personal interests. It aims to develop in pupils library research skills, inquiry skills, learning-how-to-learn skills as well as written, oral and visual communication skills. It offers pupils the opportunity to pursue a self-selected real-life problem like a "practising professional" would.
*   The P4 GEP pupils are introduced to research and formally taught research skills and processes. When these pupils go to P5, they are expected to apply and internalize their research skills and knowledge of research through experiential learning â€“ completing a research project of their interest.
