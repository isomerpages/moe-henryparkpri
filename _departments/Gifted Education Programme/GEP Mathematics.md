### Our Goals

*  Enhance every child's mathematical potential through the use of differentiated instructional approaches, investigative work, problem-posing tasks, games, and puzzles..
* Enable students to acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills for everyday life through hands-on and out-of-class activities, such as traffic counting, supermarket visits, mathematical modelling, and ICT lessons. .
* Foster a positive attitude towards mathematics by incorporating real-world applications of mathematics and demonstrating how it can solve practical problems.  .
