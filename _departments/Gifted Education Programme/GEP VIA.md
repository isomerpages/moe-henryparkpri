Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support studentsâ€™ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. To develop qualities for responsible leadership and inspire commitment to serve society and nation, students work on VIA projects involving Animal Welfare, Children with Special Needs and Understanding the Elderly.
