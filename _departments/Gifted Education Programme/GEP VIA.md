<p>Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support studentsâ€™
development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully
to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge
and skills. To develop qualities for responsible leadership and inspire
commitment to serve society and nation, students work on VIA projects involving
people with physical needs, understanding the elderly and caring for our
school community.</p>
