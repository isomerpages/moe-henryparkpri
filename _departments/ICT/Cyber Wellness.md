### What is Cyber Wellness

Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. CW education aims to equip students with an understanding of online behaviour and enable them to be responsible for their own well-being in cyberspace.

### Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors: HPPS Cyber Heroes


Guided by MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework’s third principle – Positive Peer Influence, our Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors (CWSAs) enthusiastically champion school-wide Cyber Wellness outreach efforts in HPPS. Also affectionately known as the HPPS Cyber Heroes, these student leaders take on the role as advocates to share the messages of Cyber Wellness with their peers. With their leadership and service to the student community, efforts to create a safe and caring online community are amplified through peer influence.  
  
  

### Cyber Wellness Resources and Parental Tips


To complement the Cyber Wellness curriculum in HPPS, we encourage parents to:

1. Establish ground rules for the use of digital devices and the Internet.

2. Talk to your child about his/her online experiences and discuss about the benefits and risks of the Internet.

3. Get your child to share with you his/her favourite online websites and spend time online together doing family activities.

4. Reassure your child that he/she can ask you questions or talk to you if he/she runs into problems online.
