INOVAT is a customized thinking model that enables us to fulfil our mission of nurturing concerned citizens with integrity and a spirit of excellence by equipping them with the requisite skill sets, attitudes and values. Thinking routines are integrated into the activities to promote the development of the students’ thinking. Each phase of INOVAT is denoted by a different colour. Every colour is further defined by three shades from light to medium to dark, signifying the 3 different levels of attainment for P1 to P2, P3 to P4 and P5 to P6.
