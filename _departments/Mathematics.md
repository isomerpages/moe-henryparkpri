<h3></h3>
<p><strong><u>Our Goals</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Learn Math:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To enable students to acquire mathematical concepts and skills and apply
them in mathematical situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop and support studentsâ€™ cognitive and metacognitive skills in
Mathematics for them to be problem solvers imbued with emerging 21st century
competencies (21st CC).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Live Math:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To enable students to see and appreciate the relevance of Mathematics
in real life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop students to be life-long learners with the ability to think
logically, abstractly, critically and creatively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Love Math:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To nurture in students the joy of learning and to foster their positive
attitudes towards the learning of Mathematics through engaging learning
experiences.</p>

<p><strong><u>Math department Programmes &amp; Events</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>LEARNING SUPPORT IN MATHEMATICS (Primary 1 to Primary 4)</strong>
</p>
<p>The aim of Learning Support in Mathematics (or LSM) is to provide early
intervention for students who require more guidance to attain the foundational
knowledge and skills in numeracy required at their grade level. Students
are supported by a qualified LSM teacher for all their Mathematics lessons.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>FUN IN MATH (Primary 1 to Primary 3)</strong>
</p>
<p>Fun in Math programme aims to stimulate excitement and enthusiasm in Mathematics
by engaging students in mathematics related games and activities.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>MATH SUPPORT PROGRAMME (Primary 1 to Primary 6)</strong>
</p>
<p>There are 2 programmes designed to cater to the learning needs of our
students. Through these programmes, the teachers are better able to customize
and conduct Mathematics lessons at the pace which best suits the needs
of the different groups of students.</p>
<p><strong>(A) </strong>Pull-out Programme is conducted during curriculum
hours to provide support to students who may need more guidance in acquiring
Mathematics concepts and skills at their grade level.</p>
<p><strong>(B) </strong>Remedial Programme provides after-school support
to students who need additional guidance to reinforce the Mathematics concepts
taught in class.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>E2K Mathematics (Primary 4 to Primary 6)</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme aims to foster independence in mathematical
thinking skills as well as to nurture the emerging 21st CC such as resilience,
resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking and effective communication
skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Other Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>THINKING@PLAY (Primary 1 to Primary 6)</strong>
</p>
<p>Thinking@Play is an initiative aimed at providing the students with an
opportunity to play mathematics-related games. Thinking@Play sessions are
conducted during the various recesses.</p>
<p><strong>MATHEMATICS OLYMPIAD COMPETITIONS</strong>
</p>
<p>Mathematics Olympiad competitions provide our students with the opportunities
to be exposed to intellectually challenging mathematical questions, to
challenge and stretch their mathematical potential, to stimulate their
interest and to ignite their passion in mathematics.</p>
<p>The school participants in the following Mathematics Olympiads annually:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ri.edu.sg/rmo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Raffles Mathematical Olympiad (RMO)</a> organized
by Raffles Institution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://apmops.hci.edu.sg/details" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Asia-Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (APMOPS)</a> organized
by Hwa Chong Institution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.nushigh.edu.sg/nmos/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Mathematical Olympiad Singapore (NMOS)</a> organized
by NUS High School</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For all the above-mentioned competitions. registration information will
be provided to students through their Math teachers. Students interested
in participating should express their interest to their Math teachers once
the details are shared.</p>
<p>The consent/registration form will then be sent to parents via Parents
Gateway (PG).</p>
<p>To ensure the smooth processing of registrations, we request parents to
strictly adhere to the registration deadlines set by the Math department.</p>
<p><strong>CELEBRATING MATH DAY</strong>
</p>
<p>Celebrating Math Day is a day set aside in each term from Term 1 to Term
3 to focus on Math activities and learning beyond the prescribed school
syllabus. The focus theme for each term is different and there are a total
of three main themes: Mathematician Day where the students learn about
different mathematicians and their contribution; Economy Day where the
students learn about economy related concepts and ideas and Measurement
Day where concepts and ideas relating to measurements are shared with students.</p>
