<h3>Blended Learning</h3>
<p>With the development of technology, it creates opportunities for our teachers
to incorporate blended learning in their classrooms. Through a mix of home-based
and in-school activities, pupils get to leverage both online and offline
approaches to facilitate their learning of the Mother Tongue Languages.</p>

<h3>Young Journalist Enrichment Programme</h3>
<p>Young Journalist Enrichment Programme is introduced to selected Primary
4 pupils. During the programme, pupils are taught journaling skills and
how to draft good interview questions on their own to ask their interviewees.
It cultivates pupils to be critical thinkers and reflective learners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being digital natives, pupils get hands-on experiences with the usage
of ICT applications to put together a news report.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pupils also get real-life experiences to be a young journalist at our
school events, where they draft interview questions, interview fellow school
mates and school staff and broadcast their curated news to the whole school
during morning assembly.</p>
<p>Through the programme, pupils grow to become effective communicators.</p>

<h3>Making Thinking Visible</h3>
<p>Critical and creative thinking skills are very important in&nbsp;teaching
and learning. One key tool for developing and accessing these skills is
by making thinking visible. Our Mother Tongue Department teachers design
a range of activities with the incorporation of suitable thinking routines
for our pupils to support their composition writing.</p>
<p>By tapping on visible thinking routines such as “See-Think-Wonder”, “Name-Describe-Act”,
“Main-Side-Hidden” and “Sentence-Phrase-Word”, pupils make good progress
in their composition writing.</p>

<h3>Differentiated Instruction</h3>
<p>Every pupil is unique and has an individual learning style. Thus, not
all the pupils grasp a subject in the same way or share the same level
of ability. Our teachers use differentiated instruction in our daily teaching
so that we can reach everyone in class, help pupils with different learning
styles and of different ability to make great learning progress.</p>

<h3>Formative Assessment</h3>
<p>Formative assessments give teachers the ability to provide timely and
targeted feedback to the pupils. This allows our pupils to be part of the
learning environment and to develop self-assessment strategies that will
help with the understanding of their own thought processes. Our Mother
Tongue Department teachers design different types of Formative Assessment
materials in every day teaching, so that pupils could make continuous improvement
with the feedback and guidance given by their teachers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INOVAT Virtual Escape Rooms</h3>
<p>In 2021, MTL department collaborated with our Innovation Department to
design a Virtual Escape Room creation experience for our Primary 5 Higher
Mother Tongue pupils. A digital escape room is a cooperative play experience
where a team of players solves a series of puzzles online in a set amount
of time to win. Pupils translate their academic learning to the project,
building on their interpersonal and collaborative skills. This Escape Room
also ignited their creative spark and encouraged perseverance.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Events</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Mother Language Fortnight</strong></h4>
<p>The objective of the programme is to provide opportunities for pupils
to appreciate the beauty of Chinese Language and culture. It has always
been one of the crown jewels amongst the various programmes of the Mother
Tongue Department.</p>
<p>During the two-week long&nbsp;programme, pupils were engaged in many fun-filled
activities like calligraphy, karaoke, story-telling and the appreciation&nbsp;of
Chinese tea. There were also level competitions such as Creative Reading
and Writing competitions.</p>
<p>In 2021, “Mother Tongue-Cool” was also introduced to the pupils.</p>
<p>Students responded extremely well to the “Mother Tongue- Cool” activities,
which encouraged pupils to share instances of them engaged in various daily
activities whereby they are using their Mother Tongue Language. Creativity
was unleashed and hidden gems unearthed as pupils showcased their talents
through singing, comics drawing, acting out short skits and writing. It
was truly an enjoyable time for both pupils and teachers alike.</p>
<p>Besides the “Mother Tongue- Cool” activities, pupils also engaged in various
cultural activities. Our Malay pupils did “Kite Colouring”, “Wayang Kuilt
Puppetry”and “Coaster Weaving”; “Agal Vilakku Painting”and “Copper Tooling”
for our Tamil pupils; “Shadow puppet making” ,“Sachet making” and “Traditional
Face Painting” for our Chinese&nbsp;pupils. These activities encouraged
pupils to learn more about their culture in a fun and engaging manner.</p>
