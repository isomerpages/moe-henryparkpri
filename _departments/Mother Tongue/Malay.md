<h3>MALAY PROGRAMMES</h3>
<h3>Reading Programme&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Students are encouraged to read books to lay a strong foundation in their
Malay language learning and to build up their vocabulary. Activities conducted

<h3>Joy of Learning: Fiesta Kampung</h3>
<p>To promote the use of the Malay Language and creating cultural awareness,
students of HPPS participated in an inaugural 'Fiesta Kampung' event. This
event is a collaboration with other primary schools in the W1 cluster.
Pupils from Primary 1 to 5 showcased their talent in playing various traditional
games such as bola baling, tapak gajah, capteh, sepak takraw and tarik
upih. Students get to embark on learning beyond the textbooks and classrooms,
making the learning of Malay language more interesting and meaningful.
They learned about the Malay culture in an interactive way, creating a
learning environment where students experience successes through meaningful
learning and character development.</p>

<h3>Cultural Performance Experience</h3>
<p>Its aim is to enrich students’ learning and love for the Malay Language
(ML) by encouraging them to attend and experience local Malay cultural
performances and provides students with immersive experience in the arts
outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>As part of MOE’s initiative and to enrich our students’ learning and love
for the Malay Language (ML), we have organized a learning journey to a
Malay Language theatre performance, on the 4th of November 2024.</p>
<p>Students from P4 to P6 enjoyed a 90-minute performance entitled 'Zonet
– Pengembara Sepi' which was presented by Teater Kami Limited. Through
the performance, students gained the opportunity to understand the Malay
culture such as dikir barat, tarian and silat – in their respective groups
and learnt language through drama. It was certainly an unforgettable immersive
experience for the students.</p>
