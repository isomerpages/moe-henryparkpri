appreciate Traditional Cultural Art and Craft such as Batik Painting. At

the museum.</p>

music performing. In these two years, students embark on various platforms,
such as music making through software app, to build and hone various music
skills. The P5 students learn to do simple chordal strumming on the ukulele
and are challenged to sing and play at the same time. The P6s learn to
compose music iPad apps such as Garage Band.</p>
