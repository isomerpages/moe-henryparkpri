<p>To engage our high progress learners (from mainstream Primary 4 to 6)
in scientific investigations involving more&nbsp; advanced&nbsp;Science
concepts. They foster independence in scientific inquiry in students as
well as other important 21st&nbsp;Century&nbsp;Competencies such as resilience
&amp; resourcefulness, critical &amp; inventive thinking, &amp; effective
communication skills. Lessons&nbsp;covered are either based on physical
or life Sciences</p>

<li>
<p>Junior Da Vinci / Nobel / MCurie2 Science Workshops by NUS High School
Primary 5 students are selected to participate in the Junior Da Vinci Programme
by NUS High School. This programme&nbsp;helps to&nbsp;foster collaboration
between the teachers of both schools, giving opportunities to explore other
ways to nurture and develop&nbsp;our&nbsp;students’ competencies in the
learning of Science especially with respect to the 21st Century Competencies</p>

<p>YOUNG INVESTIGATORS' PROJECT (YIP)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Inquiry-based learning is greatly enhanced by the YIP programme carried
out in Primary 4 and 5. It is conducted yearly over a period of five weeks.
The Fun with Variables package done in Primary 3 prepares the students
for this YIP programme.</p>
<p>A YI resource package, consisting of proposal forms and roles &amp; responsibilities
is made available for teachers to refer to and use with their students.
This helps to hone leadership and collaborative skills amongst the students.
The project helps students to learn and practise critical thinking, inquiry
and investigative skills.&nbsp; It helps to foster imagination and creative
thought. They learn to work with others as a team, learn discipline in
project management and organisational skills. These are essential skills
that students need to develop to succeed in life.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>OUTDOOR LEARNING</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning of Science in HPPS is not bound by the walls of the classroom.
Outdoor learning is infused into the curriculum&nbsp;to&nbsp;enrich their
learning experiences.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learning Journey</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our students get to see first-hand what they have been learning in class
and interact actively with nature. The greatest&nbsp;take-away for our
students is to be able to share the passion for nature that the teachers
/ guides have. Through that,&nbsp;they develop&nbsp;greater respect and
care for the natural resources that we often take for granted.</p>
<p>**Enrichment Lessons at the Science Centre **</p>
<p>As an extension to classroom experiences, students also attend lessons
offered by the Singapore Science Centre that targets at specific topics
covered in the syllabus.</p>

<h3>The Pedagogy</h3>
<p>The Science curriculum at HPPS adopts the pedagogy of Inquiry-based Learning
(IBL) in the teaching of Science. We believe that students learn Science
best, when they participate actively in learning, in a collaborative and
inquiry based classroom.</p>
<p>Active learning through inquiry takes place when students,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>take ownership of the initial question</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conduct individual experimentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strive for the outcome they want to see</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are able to access the needed information easily by knowing what it is
that they are looking for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are able to communicate their learning with other children through speaking
and writing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through active learning, our students learn better, as the questions they
ask help them comprehend and synthesize knowledge.</p>
<p>With the above mentioned as guiding principles, HPPS capitalises on the
following strategies to ensure that IBL is carried out holistically.</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;Questioning</p>
<p>In our day-to-day teaching of Science, our teachers focus on asking questions
as well as encouraging students to ask relevant questions. Questioning
strategy allows for a high degree of student participation as a good mix
of low and high level cognitive questions are used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;Self-Directed Learning (SDL)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through SDL, the teaching and learning conditions targeted to meet the
needs of our students are established. Here, students take initiatives,
set their own goals for learning and follow personal instructional and
planning strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;Cooperative Learning (CoL)&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoL is a well-researched instructional strategy that has been reported
to be highly successful in the classroom. It provides students with the
tools to effectively work in a collaborative environment. Many of our Science
investigations in the classroom provide opportunities for group work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;Problem Based Learning (PBL)&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBL focuses on knowing and understanding issues, considering all possible
factors, brainstorming for options and eventually deciding on the best
solution. As all ideas are initially accepted, problem solving allows for
students to find the best possible solution as opposed to the easiest solution
or the first solution proposed.</p>
<h3>Inquiry-based Learning</h3>
<p>IBL is a student-centred learning process based on John Dewey’s learning
theory of constructivism. At HPPS, we use the constructivist approach for
concept development.</p>
<p>Our approach to learning of Science at HPPS is as follows.</p>
<p>Use of hands-on activities to develop concepts as students make connections
with their surroundings</p>
<p>Carrying out inquiry-based activities in and out of the classroom that
teaches our students skills through, creative problem solving, decision-making
and investigation processes</p>
<p>Providing opportunities to apply concepts in varied contexts through authentic
outdoor learning, use of ICT, self-directed as well as collaborative learning
experiences</p>
<p>The skills and attitudes we hope to nurture in our students through the
Science curriculum is aligned to our Learning Framework. Developing innovation
and talent are also included in the Science curriculum, giving our students
the opportunity to showcase their creativity and aptitude for Science,
through our school-based programmes.</p>
<p>Learning experiences also aim to inculcate ethics and attitudes such as,
Curiosity, Creativity, Integrity, Objectivity, Open-mindedness, Perseverance
and Responsibility, in our students.</p>
<p>These skills, ethics and attitudes are in line with the 21st Century Competencies,
such as Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-cultural Skills, Critical
and Inventive Thinking, and Information and Communication Skills in order
to realise our vision of seeing our students growing up to become confident
people, self-directed learners, concerned citizens, and active contributors
to the nation.</p>
