We are committed to help students develop a life-long interest in learning Science through a standards-based curriculum that includes inquiry, investigation and experimentation.

### Our goals

*   To provide authentic learning experiences to connect Science concepts to real life applications and develop students’ creative and critical thinking skills.
*   To promote deeper awareness of environmental stewardship that enhances 21CC through enriched outdoor learning experiences using inquiry-based learning.
*   To nurture the joy of learning by making Science more fun and relevant, promoting lifelong learning.
