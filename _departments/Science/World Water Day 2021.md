### World Water Day 2021


World Water Day is held on 22 March, a day designated by the United Nations to highlight the importance of water sustainability. It reminds us of the water challenges that people face around the world, and that water is an essential resource that we should cherish and protect.

  

This year for World Water Day, a record of 44 landmarks and buildings - including the Art Science Museum, the Esplanade, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer - were lit up in blue in the evenings as part of the national water agency PUB's City Turns Blue initiative.

  

In Henry Park, we had classroom activities for the different levels to commemorate World Water Day. Click on the levels below to view the best pieces.
