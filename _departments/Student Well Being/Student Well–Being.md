<h3>Social and Emotional Well Being</h3>
<p><strong>Social</strong>
</p>
<p>A student’s ability to establish and maintain positive relationships with
family, teachers and friends contributes to his or her social well-being.
HPPS seeks to equip every student with the skills to relate to and connect
with other people.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional</strong>
</p>
<p>A student’s ability to acknowledge and share positive and negative feelings
in a productive manner contributes to the students’ emotional well-being.
HPPS seeks to create opportunities for our students to have a deeper understanding
of themselves so that they can develop their strengths and work on their
weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>Social &amp; Emotional (SE) Competencies</strong>
</p>
<p>Social and Emotional Competencies are essential for students to thrive
in the 21st Century and are integral skills in MOE’s Framework for 21st
Century Competencies and Desired Student Outcomes. The five key social
and emotional competencies are:</p>
<p>a) Self-Awareness</p>
<p>b) Social Awareness</p>
<p>c) Self-Management</p>
<p>d) Relationship Management</p>
<p>e) Responsible Decision-making</p>

&amp; Games and Outdoor Education, as well as Performing Arts and Visual

<h3>Parenting Workshops</h3>
<p>Henry Park Primary School partners with Lakeside Family Services to offer
Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P). The purpose is to provide stronger
support for parents who wish to improve their children’s behaviour and
reduce parenting stress. The Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) is one
of the most effective evidence-based parenting programs in the world, backed
up by more than 30 years of ongoing research. Triple P gives parents simple
and practical strategies to help them confidently manage their children’s
behaviour, prevent problems developing and build strong, healthy relationships.
Triple P is currently used in 25 countries and has been shown to work across
cultures, socio-economic groups and in all kinds of family structures.</p>
<p>HPPS parents will have the opportunity to participate in three two-hour
seminars to enhance their parenting skills, knowledge and confidence.</p>
<p>Seminar 1 – Positive Parenting</p>
<p>Seminar 2 – Raising Confident and Competent Children</p>
<p>Seminar 3 – Raising Resilient Children</p>

<h3>Peer Support</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Peer%20Support%20Relationships.png">
</div>
<p>Our vision is for every student to be a peer supporter where students
build bonds of friendship with one another. Students form a strong network
of support in class as well as in the various activities that they go through
together.</p>
<p>Peer Support is an important part of culture-building within the school
context to create an environment which is caring and enabling.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong>
</p>
<p>During FTGP lessons, students have discussions that nurture and hone their
skills to be a good peer supporter to the people around them. These lessons
focus on kindness, care and concern towards their friends as well as how
to be a positive influence. Students are also taught how to be a good buddy
and how to ask for help should the need arise.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/student%20well-being%208.png">
</div>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong>
</p>
<p>From 2020, the school embarked on training a group of students to be leaders
to drive the peer support initiatives throughout the school. These students,
known as the Peer Supporter Leaders (PSLs) go through additional training
to equip them with the knowledge and skills to spread this culture of care
through peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing. PSLs also assume
roles in school events to be advocates for Kindness Programmes and undertake
projects to spread care and gratitude amongst their peers.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 3</strong>
</p>
<p>Tier 3 Peer Support Leaders are role models of peer support within the
school. Building on their experience as Peer Supporter Leaders, they take
on whole-school leadership roles by actively participating in school programmes,
supporting the planning and implementation of peer support initiatives,
and mentoring younger Peer Supporters. As the first line of peer support,
they listen with empathy, provide practical help, and promote positive
behaviour and early help-seeking, contributing to a caring, inclusive,
and resilient school community.</p>

<h3>Grow Well SG (GWSG)</h3>
<p>Grow Well SG is a national health promotion strategy led by MOH, MOE,
and MSF to enhance preventive care and promote healthy lifestyles among
children and adolescents. It supports parents and schools in nurturing
healthy habits from a young age through a whole-of-government approach.</p>
<p>The strategy focuses on four key areas: Eat Well, Sleep Well, Learn Well,
and Exercise Well. Our school progressively introduces these concepts and
practices to help students develop balanced, healthy routines that support
their overall well-being and learning.</p>
