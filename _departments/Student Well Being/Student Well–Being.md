### Our Goals
*   To develop essential social & emotional competencies in students for them to thrive in a fast- changing world
*   To nurture students holistically through the three domains of student well-being to better prepare them for the future
*   To support students with different needs via targeted programs and an established system of case management

### Holistic Health

It is important that students possess the knowledge and ability to recognise that their behaviour has a significant impact on their well-being and to adopt healthy habits that will lead to their optimal physical well-being.

Assembly talks, classroom engagements, exhibitions, and recess activities are organised to raise students’ awareness of holistic health.

### Pride and Purpose

The school will provide opportunities for every student to develop a positive mindset so that they not only have the desire to learn new concepts, improve skills and seek challenges in the pursuit of lifelong learning, but to thrive when faced with adversities.


Programmes such as Life Skills and Growth Mindset lessons aim to help the students identify their strengths and talents in diverse areas. The purpose of these programmes is also to build grit and perseverance in the students and acquire a heightened sense of self-awareness.

Through programmes such as Values in Action (VIA), career fairs and School Ambassador Program, the students will have the opportunity to appreciate the importance of intra-personal relationships and discover ways on how they can contribute to their family, school, and community.

### Social and Emotional Well Being
**Social**

A student’s ability to establish and maintain positive relationships with family, teachers and friends contributes to his or her social well-being. HPPS seeks to equip every student with the skills to relate to and connect with other people.

**Emotional**

A student’s ability to acknowledge and share positive and negative feelings in a productive manner contributes to the students’ emotional well-being. HPPS seeks to create opportunities for our students to have a deeper understanding of themselves so that they can develop their strengths and work on their weaknesses.

**Social & Emotional (SE) Competencies**

Social and Emotional Competencies are essential for students to thrive in the 21st Century and are integral skills in MOE’s Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Desired Student Outcomes. The five key social and emotional competencies are:

a) Self-Awareness

b) Social Awareness

c) Self-Management

d) Relationship Management

e) Responsible Decision-making
