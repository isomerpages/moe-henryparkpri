### Our Goals
*   To develop essential social & emotional competencies in students for them to thrive in a fast- changing world
*   To nurture students holistically through the three domains of student well-being to better prepare them for the future
*   To support students with different needs via targeted programs and an established system of case management

### Holistic Health

It is important that students possess the knowledge and ability to recognise that their behaviour has a significant impact on their well-being and to adopt healthy habits that will lead to their optimal physical well-being.

Assembly talks, classroom engagements, exhibitions, and recess activities are organised to raise students’ awareness of holistic health.

### Assembly Programmes

### Pride and Purpose

The school will provide opportunities for every student to develop a positive mindset so that they not only have the desire to learn new concepts, improve skills and seek challenges in the pursuit of lifelong learning, but to thrive when faced with adversities.


Programmes such as Life Skills and Growth Mindset lessons aim to help the students identify their strengths and talents in diverse areas. The purpose of these programmes is also to build grit and perseverance in the students and acquire a heightened sense of self-awareness.

Through programmes such as Values in Action (VIA), career fairs and School Ambassador Program, the students will have the opportunity to appreciate the importance of intra-personal relationships and discover ways on how they can contribute to their family, school, and community.

### Social and Emotional Well Being
**Social**

A student’s ability to establish and maintain positive relationships with family, teachers and friends contributes to his or her social well-being. HPPS seeks to equip every student with the skills to relate to and connect with other people.

**Emotional**

A student’s ability to acknowledge and share positive and negative feelings in a productive manner contributes to the students’ emotional well-being. HPPS seeks to create opportunities for our students to have a deeper understanding of themselves so that they can develop their strengths and work on their weaknesses.

**Social & Emotional (SE) Competencies**

Social and Emotional Competencies are essential for students to thrive in the 21st Century and are integral skills in MOE’s Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Desired Student Outcomes. The five key social and emotional competencies are:

a) Self-Awareness

b) Social Awareness

c) Self-Management

d) Relationship Management

e) Responsible Decision-making

### Programme for Active Learning (PAL)

PAL is an initiative recommended by the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) Committee to address the need for greater emphasis on non-academic programmes in the foundation years. It aims to facilitate all-rounded development of students and support holistic learning; and provide varied avenues for students to develop social and emotional (SE) competencies and Character Education (CE) values. PAL is an avenue to equip students with the relevant skills, knowledge and dispositions to thrive in the 21st Century.

  

PAL incorporates values education and is experiential in nature where students learn in a creative way. It provides opportunities for students to create and develop their SE competencies. PAL is fun and enjoyable. Through PAL, 3Cs in students; namely, Curiosity, Cooperation and Confidence, will be nurtured.

  

PAL consists of modules of activities in two broad areas: Sports & Games and Outdoor Education, and Performing Arts and Visual Arts, to provide students with broad exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities.

### Positive Parenting Program

**Triple P takes the guesswork out of parenting**

The Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) is one of the most effective evidence-based parenting programs in the world, backed up by more than 30 years of ongoing research. Triple P gives parents simple and practical strategies to help them confidently manage their children’s behaviour, prevent problems developing and build strong, healthy relationships. Triple P is currently used in 25 countries and has been shown to work across cultures, socio-economic groups and in all kinds of family structures.

  

The five steps to creating a happier family life in Triple P include:-

1.    Create a safe, interesting environment

2.    Have a positive learning environment

3.    Use assertive discipline

4.    Have realistic expectations

5.    Take care of yourself as a parent

  

Henry Park Primary School is among the first few schools to partner the Ministry of Social and Family Development to offer Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P). The purpose is to provide stronger support for parents who wish to improve their children’s behaviour and reduce parenting stress.

  

HPPS parents will have the opportunity to participate in three two-hour seminars to enhance their parenting skills, knowledge and confidence.

  

Seminar 1 – Positive Parenting

Seminar 2 – Raising Confident and Competent Children

Seminar 3 – Raising Resilient Children

  

The school also organises parenting workshops and father-child bonding sessions to support our parents in their parenting journey!

### Peer Support Programme

<img src="/images/Peer%20Support%20Relationships.png" 
     style="width:70%">

Our vision is for every student to be a peer supporter where students build bonds of friendship with one another. Students form a strong network of support in class as well as in the various activities that they go through together.

Peer Support is an important part of culture-building within the school context to create an environment which is caring and enabling.

**Tier 1**

During FTGP lessons, students go through lessons to nurture and hone their skills to be a good peer supporter. These lessons focus on kindness, care and concern towards their friends and how to be a positive influence and encourage their friends towards good behaviour and character. Students are also taught how to be a good buddy and how to ask for help should the need arises.

From 2020, the school embarked on training a group of students to be leaders to drive this programme. These students known as the Student Peer Supporters (SPS) go through additional training to equip them with knowledge and skills to spread this culture of care through peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing. SPS also assume roles in school events to be advocates for Kindness Programmes and undertake projects to spread care and gratitude amongst their peers.
