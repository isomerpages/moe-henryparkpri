<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop essential social &amp; emotional competencies in students for
them to thrive in a fast- changing world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To nurture students holistically through the three domains of student
well-being to better prepare them for the future</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support students with different needs via targeted programs and an
established system of case management</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Holistic Health</h3>
<p>It is important that students possess the knowledge and ability to recognise
that their behaviour has a significant impact on their well-being and to
adopt healthy habits that will lead to their optimal physical well-being.</p>
<p>Assembly talks, classroom engagements, exhibitions, and recess activities
are organised to raise students’ awareness of holistic health.</p>

<h3>Pride and Purpose</h3>
<p>The school will provide opportunities for every student to develop a positive
mindset so that they not only have the desire to learn new concepts, improve
skills and seek challenges in the pursuit of lifelong learning, but to
thrive when faced with adversities.</p>
<p>Programmes such as Life Skills and Growth Mindset lessons aim to help
the students identify their strengths and talents in diverse areas. The
purpose of these programmes is also to build grit and perseverance in the
students and acquire a heightened sense of self-awareness.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/student%20well-being%203.png">
</div>
<p>Through programmes such as Values in Action (VIA), career fairs and School
Ambassador Program, the students will have the opportunity to appreciate
the importance of intra-personal relationships and discover ways on how
they can contribute to their family, school, and community.</p>

<h3>Social and Emotional Well Being</h3>
<p><strong>Social</strong>
</p>
<p>A student’s ability to establish and maintain positive relationships with
family, teachers and friends contributes to his or her social well-being.
HPPS seeks to equip every student with the skills to relate to and connect
with other people.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional</strong>
</p>
<p>A student’s ability to acknowledge and share positive and negative feelings
in a productive manner contributes to the students’ emotional well-being.
HPPS seeks to create opportunities for our students to have a deeper understanding
of themselves so that they can develop their strengths and work on their
weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>Social &amp; Emotional (SE) Competencies</strong>
</p>
<p>Social and Emotional Competencies are essential for students to thrive
in the 21st Century and are integral skills in MOE’s Framework for 21st
Century Competencies and Desired Student Outcomes. The five key social
and emotional competencies are:</p>
<p>a) Self-Awareness</p>
<p>b) Social Awareness</p>
<p>c) Self-Management</p>
<p>d) Relationship Management</p>
<p>e) Responsible Decision-making</p>

<h3>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</h3>
<p>PAL is an initiative recommended by the Primary Education Review and Implementation
(PERI) Committee to address the need for greater emphasis on non-academic
programmes in the foundation years. It aims to facilitate all-rounded development
of students and support holistic learning; and provide varied avenues for
students to develop social and emotional (SE) competencies and Character
Education (CE) values. PAL is an avenue to equip students with the relevant
skills, knowledge and dispositions to thrive in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>PAL incorporates values education and is experiential in nature where
students learn in a creative way. It provides opportunities for students
to create and develop their SE competencies. PAL is fun and enjoyable.
Through PAL, 3Cs in students; namely, Curiosity, Cooperation and Confidence,
will be nurtured.</p>
<p>PAL consists of modules of activities in two broad areas: Sports &amp;
Games and Outdoor Education, and Performing Arts and Visual Arts, to provide
students with broad exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities.</p>

<h3>Positive Parenting Program</h3>
<p><strong>Triple P takes the guesswork out of parenting</strong>
</p>
<p>The Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) is one of the most effective
evidence-based parenting programs in the world, backed up by more than
30 years of ongoing research. Triple P gives parents simple and practical
strategies to help them confidently manage their children’s behaviour,
prevent problems developing and build strong, healthy relationships. Triple
P is currently used in 25 countries and has been shown to work across cultures,
socio-economic groups and in all kinds of family structures.</p>
<p>The five steps to creating a happier family life in Triple P include:-</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Create a safe, interesting environment</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Have a positive learning environment</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Use assertive discipline</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Have realistic expectations</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Take care of yourself as a parent</p>
<p>Henry Park Primary School is among the first few schools to partner the
Ministry of Social and Family Development to offer Positive Parenting Programme
(Triple P). The purpose is to provide stronger support for parents who
wish to improve their children’s behaviour and reduce parenting stress.</p>
<p>HPPS parents will have the opportunity to participate in three two-hour
seminars to enhance their parenting skills, knowledge and confidence.</p>
<p>Seminar 1 – Positive Parenting</p>
<p>Seminar 2 – Raising Confident and Competent Children</p>
<p>Seminar 3 – Raising Resilient Children</p>
<p>The school also organises parenting workshops and father-child bonding
sessions to support our parents in their parenting journey!</p>

<h3>Peer Support Programme</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Peer%20Support%20Relationships.png">
</div>
<p>Our vision is for every student to be a peer supporter where students
build bonds of friendship with one another. Students form a strong network
of support in class as well as in the various activities that they go through
together.</p>
<p>Peer Support is an important part of culture-building within the school
context to create an environment which is caring and enabling.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong>
</p>
<p>During FTGP lessons, students go through lessons to nurture and hone their
skills to be a good peer supporter. These lessons focus on kindness, care
and concern towards their friends and how to be a positive influence and
encourage their friends towards good behaviour and character. Students
are also taught how to be a good buddy and how to ask for help should the
need arises.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/student%20well-being%208.png">
</div>
<p>From 2020, the school embarked on training a group of students to be leaders
to drive this programme. These students known as the Student Peer Supporters
(SPS) go through additional training to equip them with knowledge and skills
to spread this culture of care through peer bonding, peer helping and peer
influencing. SPS also assume roles in school events to be advocates for
Kindness Programmes and undertake projects to spread care and gratitude
amongst their peers.</p>
