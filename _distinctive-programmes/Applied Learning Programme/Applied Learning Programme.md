<h3>Science for Life in HPPS - ALP Sustainability</h3>
<p>Henry Park Primary offers Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Sustainability
that focuses on <em>Environmental Science</em>.&nbsp;Through authentic learning
experiences, the&nbsp;ALP&nbsp;is designed to nurture and develop students
who will care deeply for the environment. It develops students to be a
community that focuses on environmental sustainability in all aspects of
life, inside and outside of school. Further, the&nbsp;ALP&nbsp;aims to
foster specific skills and competencies in our students through an inquiry-based
curriculum. The&nbsp;ALP&nbsp;curriculum includes design thinking approach,
STEM and problem-based learning as well. Guidelines to sustainability activities
is drawn from the HPPS Green Plan that has the following key focus areas:
growing environmental leaders, enhancing eco facilities and biodiversity
within HPPS, nurturing responsible consumption and a caring school culture.</p>

<p>The theme for Science Activities for the lower primary are Sustainability
and STEM.</p>
<p><strong>P1</strong> activities aligned to Math Topics on Shapes and Length.
Students design a toy in groups and a bridge to solve a problem based on
a story, both using recyclable materials.</p>
<p><strong>P2</strong> dissect and study parts of flowers as an extended activity
based on P2 learning journey to the Singapore Orchid Gardens. Then using
parts of a White Lily, students to create a new flower.</p>

<br>This programme guides students to practise process skills taught and learn
to solve real world environmental problems by engaging in investigative
projects.</p>
<p>In P3, students learn about variables, fair test and carrying out simple
investigations in preparation for YIP in P4 and P5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P4 students are involves in Toy Car Making and Investigating speed of
the Toy Car. For P5 students&nbsp; there is an infusion of STEM into investigative
science projects based on environmental theme. In P6 students practise
the YI Process skills covered in P3 to P5.</p>

<p><strong><u>Every Child A&nbsp; Seed and Rice Cultivation</u></strong> 
<br>To inculcate a love for nature and animals in P3 students grow their very
own plant from resources NParks provide. Objectives are to provide an opportunity
to grow a plant, appreciate the challenges of the planting process and
experience the joy of seeing the plants grow</p>
<p>P3 students also use hydroponics (Eco Smart System) to grow vegetables
which is aligned to P3 science curriculum (Plant Lifecycle and Diversity)</p>
<p>In P4 students focus on growing rice plant in the school compound. Students
understand the uniqueness of the rice plant and how it grows. In the process,
they were also able to make connections to the Science Curriculum on Plant
reproduction and plant as a system. Our students also learn the importance
of sustainability and food security.</p>

sustainability projects within the Science Club, GMs support various green
activities by our School Green Committee such as paper and plastic recycling,
pre-assembly sharing for all students on sustainability, food waste recycling
after recess and food security. GMs are also taken on farm visit to raise
awareness on food security issues.</p>
