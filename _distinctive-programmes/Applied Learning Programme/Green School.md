<h4><center>Green School Vision</center></h4>


Singapore’s national vision and plans for a more liveable and sustainable Singapore is outlined in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB), which was launched in 2014. The SSB has laid out targets to achieve Singapore’s ambition in practising sustainable development. 

  

Similarly, HPPS hopes to foster specific skills, and competencies in our students and ourselves as a community that focuses on environmental sustainability in all aspects of everyday life, inside and outside of school. 

<h4><center>Green School Objectives</center></h4>

1.  To raise awareness about environmental issues among members of the school community.
2.  To motivate staff and students to take concrete actions that contributes to sustainable living in their own ways.
3.  To promote deeper awareness of environmental stewardship among students that enhances 21CC through enriched outdoor and authentic learning experiences using inquiry-based learning
