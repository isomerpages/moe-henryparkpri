### **Sports4Life@HPPS**

In Henry Park Primary, the Talent Development Framework provides for an enriched curriculum, through which the school seeks to develop HPPS students in four domains: cognitive, aesthetic, physical, and leadership. The teachers strive to make every child a Talented All-rounded Individual.  
  
Sports4Life@HPPS is the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP). It will focus on developing both the physical and leadership domains. It supports the school vision ( _A Leader in Every Child – with Talents and Strength of Character)_ and the school mission (Nurturing Leaders through a Distinctive Education in Learning and Character Development).  
  
Sports4Life@HPPS aims to:  
  

1.  reinforce the school values of Respect, Integrity, Care & Excellence with close reference to the Olympic values as a guide to promote sportsmanship,
2.  promote a passion for sports through experiential learning,
3.  develop leaders in sports.

  
Sports4Life@HPPS is centred on the experiential approach, based on David Kolb’s theory of experiential learning. Under this approach, one’s learning is cyclical, with the focus being on the process of the 4 modes within the learning cycle. One mode involves the learner going through the experience of a learning task, followed by the next mode where the learner makes observations about, and reflects upon his own learning. In the following mode, the learner thinks critically about his experience and conceptualizes it, and then finally, repeats the experience by applying new knowledge gleaned from the 3 modes of feeling, thinking and conceptualizing, which preceded it. Under Kolb’s theory of experiential learning, a learner may begin his process of learning anywhere within the learning cycle.

This cycle is followed closely when teachers carry out their lessons, giving students opportunities to learn and practise specific game skills. Peer observation is encouraged to allow for dialogue and reflective discussion on student’s acquisition of skills. This creates among learners an awareness to be self-directed in their learning and improve their game play. At the same time, explicit school values will be highlighted to encourage:  
  
**R** espect for rules and players  
**I** ntegrity and fair play  
**C** are for team mates and opponents  
**E** xcellence in sportsmanship  
  
With Kolb’s theory undergirding the Sports4Life@HPPS (Tier 1), the focus is to provide sporting experiences for ALL students to participate in.  
  
**Modular Gymnastics Programme (P1-3)**

As part of the enriched PE curriculum, the school continues to develop students’ motor skills through a Modular Gymnastics programme from P1 to P3, under which, they build flexibility, agility and strength, which serve as the foundation of all physical activities. At Primary 1 and 2, students learn about foundational positions and movements. At Primary 3, they learn to fit these foundational movements together to form complex sequences. This is fundamental to the development of more advanced motor skills at upper primary. In addition, the students develop confidence and gain an appreciation of artistic and expressive movement in sports Values such as resilience, perseverance and team work will be reiterated as students are taught the discipline behind gymnastics.  
  
**Modular Sports Programme (P4-6)**  

From P4 to P6, the students’ PE experience includes being introduced to sports and games that promote collaboration, effective team work as well as strategic game play. This is implemented via our Modular Sports programme, where sports such as Tchoukball, Frisbee, Floorball, Rounders, Basketball and Football are taught to the students. Through the experience of learning different sports through games, our students acquire targeted skills across the years; they learn about spatial awareness in P4, teamwork and gameplay in P5 and P6. Intra-school sporting events such as the Interclass Games serve as a platform for our students to apply the technical skills and strategies they have learnt from the Modular Sports programme.  
  
The students get ample opportunities to work in teams and must therefore learn to collaborate with each other. They learn the importance of demonstrating integrity by abiding by the rules of the game. They are taught to take care of their teammates who may be weaker players, and to respect the referee/teacher’s final decision. They learn that it is important to give of their best and to demonstrate good sportsmanship, regardless of the result. Through their teacher’s coaching, they will become adept at reflecting on the errors made during the game and to refine their techniques or gameplay (Annex B - SOW for Modular Sports Programme).  
  
Students who are talented in, or who show potential during the Sports4Life (Tier 1) are talent-scouted and identified for further development in Tier 2.  
  
**Specialised Skill Training**

In Tier 2, the students undergo specialised training to deepen their knowledge and skills in the respective sports CCA/ECCA. At this level, there is greater emphasis on strength and fitness conditioning as well as sport-specific gameplay. The students who undergo the training programmes at Tier 2 are given the opportunity to apply the skills they have acquired through competing at zonal or national levels.  
  
**Sports Leadership Training**  

Beyond developing the students in the physical domain, one key feature of the LLP in Tier 2 is that of developing sports leaders in the school. Within the sports CCAs, students who display leadership potential will be identified for placement in the Sports Leadership Training Programme. The students undergo training modules where they gain knowledge of leadership and mentoring skills. In addition, they will also complete several sports studies modules, which will include basic first-aid and sports event management.  
  
The school will provide opportunities for the sports leaders to apply their leadership skills by enlisting their help to assist in organising try-outs for their respective sports, running team building activities for their teammates to build a sense of camaraderie as well as mentoring their peers/juniors in game skills. They will also be given platforms to share inspiring stories of sportsmen, drawing out the values and qualities that were necessary for them to achieve excellence in their field of sports. In this way, the sports leaders will inspire and encourage their peers as they persevere together through the rigour of training.  
  
Students who are in the Sports Leadership Training programme will thus be developed across 2 domains - the physical and leadership domains. They will be groomed to be the school’s sports ambassadors, exemplifying our school’s RICE values through the various key sports (i.e. badminton, table-tennis, tennis, netball, basketball, track & field & soccer).
