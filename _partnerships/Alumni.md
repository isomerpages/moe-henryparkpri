The Henry Park Primary School (HPPS) Alumni Association was formed with the goal to reach, serve and engage all HPPS alumni.

  

This volunteer-driven association aims to foster valuable relationships and interaction among former students of HPPS. It also aims to promote a true spirit of loyalty and love for the alma mater. The Alumni Association has also been supporting the school in fundraising and school programmes as well.
