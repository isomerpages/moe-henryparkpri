### Henry Park Primary Parents' Association

HPPA is the bridge between the school and parents. We organize activities that support the school and the learning of our children. At the same time, we forge new friendships among parents through volunteering together in school events, as well as share parenting tips and provide information on school programmes. 

Due to the pandemic and safety measures, we cannot carry on with some of our past programmes like the weekly story telling but join us, and we will keep you informed via our chatgroups once we have activities planned.

Please contact HPPA via email at **[hppa.exco@gmail.com](mailto:hppa.exco@gmail.com)**
