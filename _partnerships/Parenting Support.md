MSF introduced prevention-oriented evidence-based parenting programmes (EBP) in 2014 to provide preventive and upstream support to mainstream parents and those with higher parenting needs, especially those with children in the transition years (“tweens and teens”). These programmes were founded on some 30 years of research and are found to be effective in countries around the world including Singapore.
