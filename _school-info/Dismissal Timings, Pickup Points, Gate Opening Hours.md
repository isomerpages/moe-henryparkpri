<p>As part of our school's efforts to decongest and ensure safety of our
children, we will practice staggered dismissal of students from their classrooms
by levels.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="/files/Appendix_1_Gate_Opening_Hours_Dismissal.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Appendix 1</a> for
gate opening hours for arrival and dismissal and pickup points for children
walking or taking public transport.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>:&nbsp; For <strong><u>families with children from across levels</u></strong>,
the Lower Primary child(ren) will always follow the Upper Primary sibling’s
pick up point. The P1-P3 students will all proceed to the Library to wait
for their Upper Primary siblings.&nbsp; On days where the Upper Primary
child is on HBL or is staying back in school for lessons, the Lower Primary
sibling will still proceed to the Bus Bay for pick up. For example, in
Term 3 Week 2, if a P2 child has a P4/P5 sibling (who is on HBL), the P2
child’s vehicle pickup will still be at the Bus Bay. This is to ensure
consistency for the children and parents.</p>
