<p>As part of our school's efforts to decongest and ensure safety of our children, we will practice staggered dismissal of students from their classrooms by levels.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Pickup Points for Children to be Picked Up by Car" src="/images/Picket_up_Points.JPG"></div><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>:&nbsp; For <strong><u>families with children from across levels</u></strong>, the Lower Primary child(ren) will always follow the Upper Primary sibling’s pick up point. The P1-P3 students will all proceed to the Library to wait for their Upper Primary siblings.&nbsp; On days where the Upper Primary child is on HBL or is staying back in school for lessons, the Lower Primary sibling will still proceed to the Bus Bay for pick up. For example, in Term 3 Week 2, if a P2 child has a P4/P5 sibling (who is on HBL), the P2 child’s vehicle pickup will still be at the Bus Bay. This is to ensure consistency for the children and parents.</p><p>Please refer to Appendix 1 for gate opening hours for arrival and dismissal and pickup points for children walking or taking public transport.</p><p><a href="/files/Appendix_1_2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Appendix 1</a></p>
