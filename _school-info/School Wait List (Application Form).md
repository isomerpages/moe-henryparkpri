submit all required supporting documents. The school will contact applicants
directly should a vacancy becomes available for your child.</p>
<p>Should you not receive communication from the school by 31 August 2026
and would like your child to remain on the waiting list for Academic Year
2027, please submit a fresh application during the subsequent application
window from 1 September 2026 to 20 August 2027.</p>
<p>Please be advised that students currently enrolled in Higher Mother Tongue
Language (HMTL) programmes may not necessarily be offered the same opportunity,
as this is subject to the school's assessment of various institutional
factors. This consideration similarly applies to Co-Curricular Activity
(CCA) offerings.</p>
