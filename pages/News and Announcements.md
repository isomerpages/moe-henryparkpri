<p><strong><u>Teachers' Day Celebration on 29 Aug 2024, Thursday</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dear HPPS Alumni,</p>
<p>With Teachers' Day just around the corner, we know many of you might be
planning to drop by and visit your HPPS teachers. It is always heartwarming
to see familiar faces and catch up on how far you have come.</p>
<p>On 29 August, our teachers will be out for a special lunch event and will
not be available for visits at school.</p>
<p>If you would still like to see your teachers, we encourage you to reach
out to them directly via email to arrange another time that works for everyone.
They would love to reconnect with you when they are available.</p>
