the Centre for Fathering and supported by the Ministry of Social and Family
Development (MSF) to encourage all Singaporeans to consciously set aside
time that day to be with their families and to remind families to eat together
regularly (<a href="http://fathers.com.sg/ewyfd/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>).</p>
